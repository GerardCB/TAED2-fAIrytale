# fAIrytale

The objective of this project is to offer a service that given a set of paragraphs that conforms a fairy tail returns a set of children's illustrations.

## Data

All the labeled data was obtained through web scrapping with [**monkeypen**](https://monkeypen.com/pages/free-childrens-books/), using 49 of the 50 available books that the web has available.

## Installation

There's no need of installation, the execution of the program is entirelly in the cloud. Through the web page [**fairytale**](https://fairytale.com) you'll be able to connect with the server, so you can send your fairytale and recieve a set of images.

## Examples

The user sends the next phrase: "I turned around and took one step. Into a puddle, and now I am wet.", and recieves the next illustration.
