One day Sally Sue noticed that the plants \n\ndidn\u2019t look good. They had brown spots on their leaves and it looked like something was eating them.","Sally Sue\u2019s mommy said that it looked like there were little bugs called aphids eating her vegetable plants. Sally Sue was sad. But her mommy told her not to worry. In a few days there would be some hero bugs coming to the rescue.","The next day, when Sally Sue went to the garden, she saw pretty, little beetles all over. They were red with black dots on their back. Her mommy saw that Sally Sue was afraid that these bugs would also eat her vegetable plants, so she yelled out \u201cThe heroes are here. Three cheers for the Ladybugs.\u201d","\u201cLadybugs?\u201d Sally Sue asked. \u201cYou mean the heroes are girls?\u201d Then she asked, \u201cWhere are the boy bugs?\u201d Her mommy then explained that there were both girl and boy beetles and that they were just called Ladybugs. \u201cThen why are they called Ladybugs?\u201d Sally Sue asked.","Her mommy then explained that when she was little, her grandfather had told her that since they were pretty, and all little ladies are pretty, just like you Sally Sue, they became known as Ladybugs. \u201cOh\u201d said Sally Sue. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d \u201cI was also told that many years ago, in the middle ages, the farmers crops were being eaten by aphids and they prayed to Mother Nature for help.\u201d","\u201cIn the next few days, these beetles came and ate the aphids, saving their crops. In respect for their prayers being answered by Mother Nature, they named them Beetle of the Lady.

We actually have 4 ways of moving. And since we don\u2019t have legs we use our tummy scales and muscles to get us around.","Most of you think slithering is the only way we move. It is our most common way and you could think of it as your walking. We push off something like a bump on the ground or a rock to get going. Then we move in a wavy motion using our tummy scales and muscles to pull us along. It is called the Serpentine method but slithering is just fine.","We can hold on to something with our tail portion, even the ground, and spring our front part forward. Then we drop the front part, hang on, and pull our back part along. Maybe this is like your running as we can go pretty fast. It is called the Concertina method but slithering is just fine.","In the sand, mud, or on slippery rocks we move along in a funny way. It is like your hopping. It\u2019s hard to tell you how we do it. It looks like we toss our head forward, but off to the side, not straight ahead. Then the rest of our body follows in a sideways motion. It is called Sidewinding but slithering is just fine.","Sometimes you slowly crawl on your tummy. Well, so do we. When we need to be quiet and move very slowly, we use some of our wide scales on our back part to grip the ground. Then we push straight ahead with the others. It is called the Rectilinear method but slithering is just fine.","People walk, run, hop, and crawl. We snakes serpentine, concertina, sidewind, and rectilinear. And we both get to where we want to go.","Wow! After talking to you about the way we move, I guess it is easier just to say we SLITHER."],"26":["I am Freddie and I just learned something.

A playful book full of wonderful illustrations and quirky tricks that will have every child wanting to reach for the wand and become a bubble scientist.","\u201cWow!\u201d Tristan said as he watched the man on the street corner make bubbles.\n\nBig bubbles, little bubbles, tiny bubbles too. Bubbles from a wand, some landing on his shoe.Bubbles in the air, bubbles on the ground, Bubbles blowing on the wind, making a popping sound.Their colors like a rainbow, their shape so round and true.Bubbles, bubbles everywhere. Look - that one is blue.\u201d Tristan thought to himself. \u201cI just have to find out how to make those bubbles.\u201dSo, he walked up to the man and asked him how he did it.","\u201cExcuse me, Sir,\u201d Tristan said.\u201cI have never seen bubbles like that and I would really like to know how to make them.They are the most beautiful things I have ever seen.\u201d The man stopped blowing bubbles, smiled, and said: \u201cWhy, thank you young man! When I was about your age, I saw someone blowing bubbles and, well, I asked how he made them. He told me and once I started, I just couldn\u2019t stop.Just a minute, while I blow some more.\u201d","When he finished, he looked at Tristan, grinned, and said, \u201cWould you like to try blowing some?\u201d \u201cCould I?\u201d exclaimed Tristan.Tristan took the wand, dipped it, \n\nmoved it gently through the air, and the biggest bubble he ever saw rose into the sky. He squealed with delight. The man then explained some important things \n\nto remember when blowing bubbles.","\u201cI can remember that,\u201d Tristan said. \u201cBut how do I make the solution and the wands.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201dThe man said in a whisper.\u201cLet me blow some more bubbles \n\nand then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d He then took a wand in each hand, dipped them, extended his arms, and began spinning. Soon there was a wall of bubbles. So many bubbles that Tristan couldn\u2019t see the man anymore.Then he heard a laugh and POP!Pop! \u2026 Pop! Pop! Pop! \u2026 Pop! Pop! \u2026Pop!

A Bubble Scientist\u2019s Basic GuidePop! \u2013 Remember to experiment with the basic solution.A little more glycerin, sugar, or syrup can make a stronger bubble. Too much can ruin your solution. Pop! Pop! - If you need more just double, triple, or quadruple the ingredients. Pop! Pop! Pop! \u2013Don\u2019t forget what I told you earlier.","If you make your own bubble solution, pretend you\u2019re a scientist, and experiment to make the mix that you like.All solutions use Glycerin but it is expensive. Remember that you can use a light corn syrup (like karo) or even sugar. It is best to make your mix and let it rest for a day.This helps make a stronger bubble. But don\u2019t worry. You can use it as soon as you make it.\n\nStore your mix in a tightly sealed container. Pour your solution into a shallow tray or bowl for dipping your wand. Make sure it is a little bigger than the wand you are going to use.","Make sure your wand can soak up some solution for better bubbles. If you make a smooth wire wand, wrap it in cloth so it can suck up the solution.Blow or move the wand through the air gently. You can catch or bounce bubbles if you are careful. They usually pop from dust, dirt, or grease. So wear a light pair of gloves and go on a bubble hunt.Don\u2019t shake or stir your bubble solution too much when blowing bubbles.Minerals or other additives in water can affect your \n\nsolution.It is recommended to use distilled water or boil your waterfor several minutes and let it cool before using.(Don\u2019t forget to have an adult boil the water).\n\nHAVE FUN!","Basic Bubble Solutions Pop! Pour 1\/4 cup liquid dish soap into a mixing bowl.\n\nAdd 3\/4 cup of water. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar into the mixture. (Glycerin or light corn syrup can be substituted). Gently stir your mixture until the sugar dissolves.\n\nPop! Pop!Add 1\/2 cup of water to your mixing bowl. Mix in 2 tablespoons of liquid dish soap.Stir in 1 tablespoons of light corn syrup.(Glycerin or sugar can be substituted).Pop! Pop! Pop! Dissolve 1\/2 cup of soap powder into 1 cup of warm water.Mix in 2 tablespoons of sugar, light syrup, or Glycerin. Remember \u2013 Don\u2019t throw out your solution if it doesn\u2019t work with a wand. Make Bubble-Falls. Take your solution outside and using a straw blow into the solution. Have fun with the millions of bubbles.","Basic Wands Be creative and use your imagination. Anything that holds the solution across it can be used as a wand. The bigger the wand \u2013 the bigger the bubble \u2013 the harder it is to blow. Try some things around the house. A slotted mixing spoon.A small strainer. Make one Bend a pipe cleaner (chenille craft stem) into any shape and attach another for the handle.Have an adult bend a coat hanger into a circle (or any shape). Cover it with cloth for best results.\n\nTake 2 straws and thread yarn through them. Make sure the knot is in one of the straws. Using the straws as handles dip the yarn into the solution. Gently remove it and move it through the air. It\u2019s hard to do but when you get a bubble, it will be a GIANT BUBBLE.","\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get home,\u201d Tristan said as he ran down the street."],"32":["Jimmy had just turned 5 and was starting school.","He was frightened.

What do we do if we get lost? Are there snakes? And of course: Are we there yet?","Her grandfather answered all her questions the best he could and explained \n\nthat they were in a very natural area. Not many people, all sorts of wild life, even bears. He helped her understand and respect the natural beauty around them, \n\nparticularly the animals. He taught her how to use a compass, and things to help them be safer while they hiked.","Like before stepping over a log put your walking stick on the other side to let any \n\nanimal, like a snake, know you are there.

All life is sacred; treat all life with respect.Take from the Earth what is needed and nothing more.

My name is Samantha and I want to be a scientist. You may be wondering why and my answer is simple. I am amazed at all the wonderful things like television, cellular phones, men on the Moon, space exploration, and the list goes on. But those are big things and I just don\u2019t understand everything about them yet. I also wonder about smaller things like-why do my doll\u2019s eyes close when I lay her down and open when I pick her up. Or how are cartoons made? Hmm \u2013 I know it has something to do with Science. My brother Samuel wants to be a scientist too, but he likes things that I don\u2019t, like-why Stalactites grow.\n\nBut even though we don\u2019t like the same things it\u2019s still Science so we get along just fine. In fact, our teachers help us better understand Math, technology, current events and trends - all of which are important. We even help each other and have lots of fun.","I like to experiment or take things apart to see how they work. No matter what I do, I tell my mom or dad what I am going to be doing and sometimes even ask for their help. I would never just do something. I could get hurt. Sometimes it\u2019s best to start small, and that\u2019s just what I did. I remember my first experiment in detail and it was a lot of fun to do. I had to do an optical illusion. You may be wondering why that is important and all I can say is that it\u2019s the basis for making \n\ncartoons - and here is why. Our brains fill in the gaps for whatever our eyes aren\u2019t processing. So two different pictures can actually become one or still images can appear to be moving.Try this experiment, it\u2019s lots of fun and there is nothing dangerous about it.

Then he yelled, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s play Hide-and-Seek\n\nI\u2019ll be the seeker!\u201d\n\nHe turned, faced a big tree, closed his eyes, and started counting out loud. \u201c100 \u2013 99 \u2013 98 \u2013 97 \u2026..\u201d Sally and Mark stopped arguing, looked at each other, and ran off in different directions to find a hiding place.\n\nIn the distance they could still hear Mark counting\n\n \u201c4 \u2013 3 \u2013 2 \u2013 1. Ready or not, here\n\nI come!\u201d Then he turned and began looking for places \n\nwhere they could be hiding.","Finding Sally was easy.\n\nShe always ran off and then circled back\n\nso she would be close to \u201cbase,\u201d\n\nthe safe place to get to before being tagged.\n\nMark looked for the biggest tree\n\nand ran towards it.\n\nBut she wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bet she\u2019s behind that big bush,\u201d\n\nhe said to himself.\n\nSo he ran to it and was ready to tag her,\n\nbut she wasn\u2019t there either.","As he turned around, he saw James running towards\n\n\u201cbase\u201d and darted after him. Just before\n\nhe touched James\u2019 shoulder, James tagged the \u201cbase\u201d\n\nand yelled out \u201cSAFE!\u201d \u201cDid you get Sally yet?\u201d\n\nJames asked. \u201cNo,\u201d said Mark.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to find her and it\u2019s getting late and\n\nwe need to be heading home.\u201d","So both boys yelled out\n\n\u201cCome on out Sally, it\u2019s late.\u201d\n\nBut there was no reply.\n\nNot even a little snicker from\n\nsomewhere in the darkness.\n\nThey yelled again.\n\n\u201cCome on out Sally, it\u2019s late.\u201d\n\nStill there was no reply from Sally.\n\nThey began to worry and started searching for her. As they walked around the area they called out \u201cSally, come on, we give up; you\u2019re safe.\u201d\n\nBut no matter where they looked,\n\nor how much they called out,","Sally was wondering what had happened.\n\nAll she could remember was\n\ncrawling under the big trunk\n\nof a fallen tree to hide.\n\nNow, as she looked up, she saw\n\nseveral stars through a small hole above her head.\n\nShe had fallen into a hole\n\nwhen she crawled under the tree trunk.\n\n\u201cHelp!\u201d she yelled and heard her voice\n\necho throughout what must have been a cave.\n\n\u201cHELP! Help, help, help!\u201d","\u201cDid you hear that, James?\u201d\n\nMark said excitedly.\n\n\u201cSally just yelled for help.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep yelling Sally,\u201d James screamed.\n\n\u201cThat way we can find you.\u201d\n\nSally heard her brother and\n\nkept screaming. After a short while the boys were standing next to the big tree trunk.\n\n\u201cHey! Are you stuck under this tree?\u201d\n\nasked James. \u201cKind of,\u201d Sally yelled.\n\n\u201cWhen I crawled under\n\nit to hide, I fell into a cave.\n\nPlease help me, I\u2019m scared.\n\nIt\u2019s dark and I can\u2019t get out.\u201d","Mark said,\n\n\u201cJames you stay with Sally and\n\nI will go get my dad.\u201d\n\nThen he dashed off into the darkness.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be scared,\u201d James said.\n\n\u201cI am right here with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not,\u201d Sally sobbed.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up there and I\u2019m down here.\u201d\n\nAs Sally turned in the darkness of the cave,\n\nshe bumped into something,\n\nscreamed, and began to cry.","\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d James yelled.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something down here with me,\u201d\n\nSally replied in a shaky voice.\n\nJust then, Mark and his dad came\n\nrunning through the woods.\n\nMark\u2019s father knelt down and asked Sally\n\nif she was okay. He could hear her crying and sobbing. \u201cSally, are you hurt?\u201d\n\nhe asked. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m scared and there is\n\nsomething down here with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cStand back Sally.\n\nI am lowering a rope and\n\nwill be down with you in a second.\u201d","Mark\u2019s dad tied the rope to the tree,\n\nfound the hole under the tree trunk,\n\nwiggled a bit, and lowered\n\nhimself into the cave.\n\nSally could see him coming down\n\nthe rope and stopped crying.\n\nNot only was he there but the cave became \n\nbrighter from the beam of\n\nhis flashlight as it danced\n\nacross the cave\u2019s floor and walls.","As he reached the floor of the cave,\n\nhe shone the light on Sally and gave\n\nher a big hug. \u201cDon\u2019t be frightened,\u201d\n\nhe said. \u201cI\u2019ll have you out of here in no time.\u201d \n\nThen he shone the light around\n\nand saw that she had fallen into a small cave. \n\nAnd very close to her,\n\nin the middle of the cave,\n\nwas something wrapped in layers\n\nof old blankets.","\u201cMark, James, there\u2019s something down here. \n\nI am going to tie it to the rope and I want you to \n\npull it out.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d they replied.\n\nThe boys pulled out the object, untied it,\n\nand let the loose end of\n\nthe rope fall back into the cave.\n\nThe cave wasn\u2019t deep and Marks\u2019\n\ndad boosted Sally over his head so she could \n\ncrawl out. He then grabbed\n\nthe rope and with a little jump, was\n\nable to grab the opening\n\nand pull himself out.","\u201cLet\u2019s go back to my house for a cup of hot tea.\n\nI\u2019ll call your parents so they aren\u2019t worried,\n\nand we\u2019ll see what treasure Sally found.\u201d He said.","When they got to Mark\u2019s house,\n\nthey sipped their tea and began unwrapping the treasure.\n\nThey carefully peeled off layers of old blankets\n\nand cloth to reveal a wooden box.\n\nThey slowly opened it and stared in amazement.","\u201cOh my,\u201d Sally said in disbelief.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe what I am seeing.\u201d\n\nThe boys and Mark\u2019s father just stared.\n\nInside the box were jewels of every color you could imagine. There were diamonds,rubies, sapphires, and emeralds \n\nof all shapes and sizes.Intermixed they could see several\n\ngold coins and strands of pearls.\u201cWe\u2019re rich,\u201d the boys screamed. \u201cNot quite,\u201d interrupted Mark\u2019s father. \u201cSomeone could have lost this and I don\u2019t think you should plan on spending any of it until we find out a little more. Besides, Sally found it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll share it,\u201d Sally said happily. \u201cThat\u2019s nice Sally,\u201d replied Marks dad. But the right thing\n\nto do is contact the authorities.\u201d","The next day, the four of them\n\nand Sally\u2019s mother drove to the police station, \n\nexplained what had happened,\n\nand gave the treasure to the police to hold while \n\nthey conducted their investigation.\n\nThey left the police station sadly\n\nand even the double dipped ice cream cones \n\nMark\u2019s father bought for them\n\ndidn\u2019t make them smile.They drove back in silence.","Several weeks passed with\n\nno word from the police.\n\nThen, one evening, Mark\u2019s father\n\ncalled James, Sally, and their parents.\n\n\u201cThe police just called and\n\nI think you should come over right now,\u201d\n\nhe said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid there is some\n\nbad news about the treasure.\n\nThe police are on their way and\n\nwill explain everything when you get here.\u201d","Sally and James didn\u2019t say\n\nmuch during the ride to Mark\u2019s house.\n\nSally thought that since it was\n\n\u201cbad news\u201d the treasure belonged\n\nto someone else, even though\n\nthey probably lost it.\n\n\u201cWhatever happened to \u2018finders-keepers\u2019?\u201d\n\nshe mumbled. \u201cWhat did you say Sally?\u201d\n\nher mother asked. \u201cOh, nothing.\u201d\n\nSally replied. Then she let out\n\na long, sad sigh that echoed\n\nthrough the car.","When they arrived at Mark\u2019s house,\n\nthe police were there with the treasure box.\n\nAs Sally entered,\n\nthe captain introduced himself and said,\n\n\u201cSally, this is yours.\n\nYour parents need to sign\n\nsome papers but the box and its\n\ncontents are yours.\u201d","Sally, Mark, and James\n\nshrieked with joy and danced\n\naround the room. Then Sally said,\n\n\u201cWhat is the bad news?\u201d\n\nThe captain smiled and said.\n\n\u201cThe treasure is worth more money than\n\nyou can imagine and with your\n\nnew found wealth comes\n\ngreat responsibility.\u201d Sally didn\u2019t quite understand \n\nwhat the captain was talking about and right now\n\nit really didn\u2019t matter.","Mark asked,\n\n\u201cAre you going to share?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Sally said.\n\n\u201cIf you and James didn\u2019t help me\n\nI might still be there.\u201d\n\nSeveral days later Sally asked\n\neveryone over to her house.\n\n\u201cI have decided what to do with\n\nthe money from the treasure after it is sold,\u201d\n\nshe said.\n\n\u201cI am giving 1\/6 to our Mom and Dad,\n\n1\/6 to Mark\u2019s Mom and Dad,\n\n1\/6 to Mark, 1\/6 to James, and 1\/6 for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is an extra 1\/6,\u201d\n\nMark proudly stated. He loved math\n\nand was right on top of Sally\u2019s calculations.","\u201cNo there\u2019s not,\u201d Sally said.\n\n\u201cIs too,\u201d James said. \u201cIs not,\u201d\n\nSally said in an angered voice. Just as\n\nMark was going to say,\n\n\u201cThey are at it again,\u201d Sally said,\n\n\u201cThis is why there isn\u2019t an extra 1\/6!\n\nI am giving it to the local charity, so\n\nit can be given to those less \n\nfortunate and in need.\u201d\n\nHer mother and father said\n\nit was a caring and responsible thing to do.\n\nThey were very proud of her and knew that she\n\nunderstood what the captain meant when he had turned\n\nthe treasure over to her just days before."]}
