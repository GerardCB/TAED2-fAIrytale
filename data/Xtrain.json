{"11":["In the rainforest, next to a wide river, there grew a great banyan tree. This tree was ancient and provided a home for the many animals living in the area.","Henrietta Heron had a beautiful nest high atop the Banyan tree. Carl Crayfish lived in tangled roots that entered the river at the waters edge. Sam the Black Snake had made his home under the great trunk of the tree. Marty Mongoose lived nearby. His home wasn\u2019t actually in the Banyan tree but close enough where the tree offered a cooling shade during the hot days and protection from the heavy rains that fell every afternoon.","His home wasn\u2019t actually in the banyan tree but close enough. The tree offered a cooling shade during the hot days and protection from the heavy rains that fell every afternoon. Now you must realize that not all animals in the rainforest are friends. They depend on one another for different things, many times for food.","To better understand this let me explain how Henrietta, Carl, Sam, and Marty live within the great Banyan tree.","Henrietta Heron had built her nest by the river so she that would be close to the food she usually ate. Her diet consisted of fish, frogs, crayfish, and even snails. She had a great home.","Now Carl Crayfish lived within the rocks and roots of the tree. Carl was really a scavenger. He would eat the pieces of food dropped by other animals and his home offered protection from animals that might snack on him.","Sam the Black Snake made his home under the great Banyan tree as it was close to many things he liked to eat. Sam preferred bird eggs but didn\u2019t hesitate to eat anything he could catch, except maybe whole crayfish as they were very hard to swallow.","Can you guess what Marty Mongoose liked to eat? Well if you said snakes, then you are absolutely correct. Marty liked to eat snakes of all types and sizes.","One day, Henrietta was out looking for food. When she returned to her nest, she found that two of her eggs were gone. Oh, how sad she was! Something had gotten into her nest and eaten two of her precious eggs.","She flew back down to the river so no other birds would see her crying. Then she saw Marty and said to him, \u201cSam must have slithered into my nest and eaten two of my eggs.\u201d \u201cThat is a shame,\u201d Marty replied in a sad voice.\n\u201cOh, what can I do?\u201d Henrietta asked.","Now Marty knew that Henrietta, and the other herons, liked to eat crayfish and, if there were an easy meal to be had, he was very interested. \u201cSo, you would like to get rid of that bothersome snake?\u201d he asked Henrietta. \u201cOh, yes!\u201d Henrietta sighed. \u201cI wish something would eat him.\u201d","\u201cHenrietta, I can help you,\u201d Marty said excitedly. \u201cYou and your heron friends need to catch all the fish and crayfish in the area. Break them into pieces and leave a trail of food from Sam\u2019s den to my home. He will be busy eating the food and he will not realize that he is close to me. He will be an easy meal for me and you will be rid of his egg stealing ways.\u201d","Henrietta thought for a minute, smiled, and then flew off to talk with the other herons. Soon the herons had captured all the fish, crayfish (even poor Carl) and made the trail of food between the snake\u2019s den and the home of the mongoose. Then they returned to their nests to watch.","As Sam slithered out of his den, he was surprised to see all the fresh snacks just lying on the ground. \u201cYummy! Yummy!\u201d he thought to himself as he began eating.","It wasn\u2019t long before Sam had eaten his way to Marty\u2019s home. As Sam opened his mouth to eat the last snack, Marty jumped out of from the bushes. Well, I don\u2019t have to tell you what happened because you already know. But in case you don\u2019t, there was a big B-U-R-P and Marty returned home.","\u201cDid you see that?\u201d Henrietta asked the other herons. \u201cNow our eggs are safe.\u201d","Several days passed. Marty was hungry but there were no snakes in the area. The other snakes saw how Sam had been tricked, so they left to find a safer home. Marty looked into the river and realized that the herons had taken\neverything from it to set the trap. Then, he looked into the great banyan tree\nand saw Henrietta.","The other herons saw Marty climbing the tree but it was too late to warn Henrietta. All they could do was leave their nests and, like the snakes, find a safer home.","Now Marty was alone. There was no food in the area, and no reason for him to stay in his nice home, protected by the great banyan tree.","The great banyan tree is now empty of all life. But there is a circle-of-life in the rainforest and it won\u2019t be long before new animals arrive at the banyan tree, and call it \u201chome\u201d."],"31":["Not long ago, in a crystal-clear river, near a small town lived two very big fish.In fact, they were so big that they were not afraid of anything.They swam anywhere they wanted.","They tangled the lines of children fishing in their river.They ate when they were hungry and splashed anyone sitting on the bank.They were the big, brave rulers of the crystal-clear river.","One day, a large bullfrog and his family moved into the area.The bullfrog saw the two big, brave fish in the crystal-clear river and wanted to talk to them.But he was afraid.","He didn\u2019t know a lot about the crystal-clear river,or the big brave fish that lived there, and was afraid of being eaten.","For a long time he watched the big, brave fish, the crystal-clear river, and \n\neverything around him to make sure it was safe.The bullfrog was very smart and used his common sense to guide him.Then, with a mighty hop, he jumped into the crystal-clear river to introduce himself.","\u201cI\u2019m Kroaker, the biggest and smartest bullfrog in the world.\u201d he said.\u201cIs that so?\u201d replied one of the fish.\u201cWe are the biggest and bravest fish in the crystal-clear river.\u201dThe other fish looked at Kroaker and said. \u201cIf you are nice we may let you share our water.\u201dThe three talked and over time, the two big, brave fish and Kroaker became friends.Every day the three of them would meet at the same spot in the crystal-clear river to eat, talk, and play.","Late one evening, as the three were talking,two fishermen passed by. \n\nKroaker saw them, and common sense told him to hop into the water and hide under the bank.The two big, brave fish slowly swam in circles so the fishermen could see just how big they were.","One of the fishermen saw them and said, \u201cThis crystal-clear river has some really big fish.Let\u2019s come back tomorrow morning and catch them.\u201d \n\nAs the fishermen turned and walked away, they discussed what type of bait might work best to catch big, brave fish.\u201cWorms.\u201d said one.\u201cNo,sausages.\u201d\n\n said the other, and they continued their discussion as they walked the twisty path along the crystal-clear river\u2019s edge.","The two big,brave fish and the Kroaker overheard the fishermen.\u201cMy friends,\u201d said Kroaker. \u201cDid you hear what they said?You should swim away and hide.\n\nI am afraid they may catch and eat me, so I will take my family to a nearby pond to be safe.\u201d","The two big, brave fish bubbled out laughs as they jumped in and out of the water.One said, \u201cMy dear bullfrog friend, don\u2019t be frightened of their mere talk.\u201d \n\nKroaker looked at the two brave fish and said, \u201cI would rather be safe than sorry.\u201d","\u201cFrom what I heard they might come back so I will leave with my family to the safety of the pond.\u201d Kroaker left and the two big, brave fish swam to the \n\nbottom of the crystal-clear river.","The next morning, just after sunrise, the two fishermen returned to the crystal-clear river where the day before they had seen the two big, brave fish.They walked slowly and quietly so as not to disturb them. \u201cLook,\u201d whispered \n\none of the fishermen,\u201cthere they are.\u201d","The fishermen gently cast their bait and let it slowly drift in the current to attract \n\nthe big, brave fish. It worked! In moments, each had hooked one of the big, brave fish.Then the battle between the fishermen and the fish began.","The big, brave fish used all their tricks to free themselves.They dived deep, swam fast, and leaped from the water, thrashing their tail and head in an attempt to get free.The battle raged for over ten minutes but in the end, the big, brave fish were no match for the fishermen. They were caught!","Kroaker watched from the safety of the tall grass that separated the pond from the bank of the crystal-clear river.","Oh, the anglers were excited! Each had caught a big brave fish on their first cast of the day.What a story they had to tell when they returned home!","Kroaker carefully hopped back to the pond and told his family what he had seen.\n\n\u201cBoth my big, brave fish friends were very talented, and still they were caught. \n\nBut I, with only common sense, saved my family.I will miss them.\u201d","\u201cWe have to learn a lesson from this,\u201d said Kroaker to his family. \u201cAt the first sign of danger, use common sense and act quickly to save yourself.\u201d"],"33":["Hi, I am Professor Mois Ture and I will be telling you about water.

Your day at the beach would be like going to a desert.","And since you are mostly made up of water - let\u2019s just say you would be a lot lighter.","The Water Cycle has 4 parts. Evaporation, Condensation Precipitation, Collection","Evaporation When the water in an ocean, a lake, a pond, a river, or a stream is heated by the sun, it turns into vapor or steam. It then floats into the air.","Of course, when you are out on a hot day, or you exercise, you sweat. Well, guess what! That evaporates too.","What about those drops of dew on leaves, or the grass?Yes - They too evaporate and become a part of the Water Cycle.","Condensation As the water vapor gets cooled, it changes back into a liquid and turns into clouds.","Precipitation When the air in the clouds cannot hold any more liquid, it falls back to the ground.","It returns in different ways, depending on the temperature and where it comes down. It can fall as rain.","Or, it can fall as snow. (Did you know that no two snowflakes are the same?)","It can return as sleet, which is like rain that has almost frozen.","Or it can come as hail. Those frozen balls of rain that can actually break windows and dent cars.","Collection No matter how it comes down, it is collected and stored. It can fall into the ocean, lake, pond, river, or stream. If it lands on the ground, it may roll into a river or be sucked up by the soil. It may even pass through the ground to an underground lake or river to be used later.","Now, what happens tomorrow when the sun comes out? That\u2019s right.

Because she was so tall, she was able to eat food from the very tops of the trees in the savannah. The savannah in Africa is an area with lots of grass and some trees. Sometimes, a savannah is called grasslands. The other animals like zebras and antelopes could not reach where Ginger could reach. But Ginger always found food. She loved the leaves and the new buds of the trees.","One day, Ginger was busy eating her favorite leaves along with some other giraffes. It was a bright sunny day and there was not a cloud in the sky. It had not rained for a long time, so the grass was very dry. She heard a noise down at the bottom of her extra long legs: it was her friend, Mickey the Monkey. Mickey was trying to say something, but Ginger couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying. He looked very tired. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d asked Ginger. Ginger was a very kind giraffe and wanted to help everyone. \n\nJust then Mickey fell over!","Ginger was also a smart giraffe. She knew what was wrong. Mickey couldn\u2019t find anything to eat and he was very hungry. Ginger nibbled some fresh, tender leaves and buds from the top of the tree where she was eating. She dropped some of the leaves and buds to the ground near where Mickey was. Then she nudged him a little with the hoof at the bottom of one of her very long legs. \u201cWake up, Mickey!\u201d said Ginger. \n\n\u201cI\u2019ve found something for you to eat.\u201d \n\nSlowly Mickey sat up and ate a little.","After a while, when Mickey was feeling better, Ginger asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s happened, Mickey? Why are you so hungry? Why can\u2019t you find anything to eat?\u201d Mickey said, \u201cIt hasn\u2019t rained for so long and now there\u2019s no more food.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d said Ginger. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening with the other animals?\u201d \u201cNo one knows what to do,\u201d answered Mickey. \u201cAll the zebras and the antelopes and the elephants are getting worried about the dry grass. \n\nSome of them are thinking about leaving the savannah and trying to reach the jungle.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a long trip,\u201d said Ginger. \n\n\u201cAre you going to go with them?\u201d","\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d answered Mickey. \u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d Ginger thought for a while and then suddenly, she had a good idea. \u201cWe should go talk to Leo the Lion. \n\nHe is the smartest animal in the savannah!\u201d Mickey was too tired to walk, so Ginger invited him to ride on her back. \u201cHold on tight to my neck,\u201d said Ginger. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to hold on to,\u201d joked Mickey. Ginger laughed. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve got the longest neck in Africa!\u201d So they started their journey across to the other side of the savannah to look for Leo.","Ginger and Mickey were in luck! Leo was sitting up on a rock and he was really easy to see as they walked through the grass. \u201cHi, Leo!\u201d they both shouted. Leo had been napping and was a little grumpy when they woke him up. But he was polite and said, \u201cHello Ginger and Mickey. Why did you walk the whole way across the savannah? Just to wake me up?\u201d But he was joking; he had a smile on his face. \u201cMickey says that there is no food left on the savannah because it\u2019s been so dry,\u201d said Ginger. \u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d","Leo thought for a while. He said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about the rain. It will come soon, but we can\u2019t be sure when it will arrive. When the rain comes, all the plants will grow again and there will be lots of food for everybody.\u201d \n\nHe thought a little longer. \u201cThe only thing I can think of is for everyone to move closer to the forest,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere will be more things to eat there, but I know it\u2019s a long trip and it will not be very easy. \n\nIt might take days to get there.\u201d","Ginger and Mickey looked at each other and then looked back at Leo. \u201cThank you, Leo,\u201d said Ginger. \u201cIt\u2019s probably best if they all try to get closer to the jungle.\u201d They said goodbye and then walked back across the savannah. \n\nNow they needed to gather all of the animals together to start the long journey. Ginger didn\u2019t need to go along because she had plenty of food in her high trees. But she was a good friend and wanted to help as much as she could. \n\nThey walked towards her favorite trees and guess what she and Mickey saw?","All of the animals were already gathered there and waiting for Ginger and Mickey! \u201cWhy are you all here?\u201d asked Ginger. \u201cEddie the Eagle told us that you\u2019re taking us to the edge of the jungle,\u201d said one of the zebras. \u201cHow did he know?\u201d asked Mickey. \u201cHe heard you talking with Leo,\u201d said one of the antelopes. \u201cSo you\u2019ve all decided to try to walk together to the jungle?\u201d asked Ginger. \u201cYes,\u201d they all answered. \u201cIf you\u2019ll help us to get there,\u201d added one of the elephants. \n\n \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll help,\u201d said Ginger. \u201cI\u2019m your friend.\u201d","So they started on their big journey across the savannah to the jungle. The sun was so hot and there was no food and no place to get a drink of water. And then they heard it. It was thunder! \u201cThunder!\u201d they all shouted. Thunder was very scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you guess why? Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire. Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly what happened. \u201cFire!\u201d they shouted. They \n\ncould smell it. And now they could see it. \n\nThe fire was coming towards them!","Ginger had to think fast. Because she was so tall she could see farther than any of the other animals. \n\nShe stretched her long neck up as far \n\nas she could. Now she could see a place where there was no fire. \u201cQuick!\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone run this way.\u201d \n\nAll of the animals followed her \n\nand ran as fast as they could. Soon, they were \n\nout of danger. They stopped and gathered together one more time. \u201cIs everyone here?\u201d Ginger asked. She wanted to make sure they were all safe. \n\nAll the animals looked around; they were all there.","And then the most wonderful thing happened. \u201cI felt a drop,\u201d said a zebra. \u201cMe too,\u201d said an antelope. It was rain! Finally! Everyone was very happy. It started to rain a little more and then a little more. The rain put out the fire so they didn\u2019t have to run. And the rain filled their watering holes and made the plants grow again, \n\nso they didn\u2019t have to make that long trip to the edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have enough food and water. So Ginger, the Giraffe went back to her favorite tree and continued to munch on the leaves and buds."],"41":["\u201cNow this looks like a very interesting case,\u201d Detective\nPeterson said aloud, as she reviewed the huge stackof reports on her desk.\u201cI think I will handle this one myself.\u201d","After several minutes of searching through the official Tooth Fairy records, she found what she was looking for.

He believes that he is the strongest animal on the farm and that gives him the right to do as he pleases. But the farm animals decide to stop him in his tracks by \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.. a great tale that moves at a quick pace, keeping the reader engrossed right to the end.","Farmer Fred had just bought a new bull. He named him Bill. Bill was a strong and handsome bull with great horns. He was very big for his age. Farmer Fred got Bill, the bull loaded into the trailer, and headed back home to his farm. When they arrived, Farmer Fred said, \u201cBill, welcome to your new home.\u201d Bill just snorted and tossed his head back to show off his impressive horns.","This was all new to Bill as he was raised in a small stall and his new home was very different. He had a lot to explore. Bill stood on the hill and watched all the barnyard animals. He thought to himself. \u201cI am the biggest animal on Farmer Fred\u2019s farm. No other animal has such great horns.\u201d","Bill chuckled at the chickens as he slowly walked up to them. They were so small and they didn\u2019t have horns. As Bill approached, the chickens clucked. The lone duck, ducked, as Bill almost stepped on her.","Bill lowered his head and quickly shook it from side to side right in front of the chickens.\u201cI\u2019m Bill, the bull and I\u2019m bigger than you chubby chickens,\u201d he said in a deep voice. \u201cAnd I am the boss of the barnyard.\u201d Bill, the bull, frightened the chickens. They rapidly ran, flipped, flopped and, flew, to the safety of their cozy coupe. This made Bill, the bull, laugh loudly. He was having fun.","Bill saw some plump pigs moving in the mud and decided to play a prank.\n\nAs he approached, he said loudly, \u201cI heard Farmer Fred say that he needed some bacon for breakfast and ham for dinner.\u201d He then laughed loudly and tossed his head around showing off his great horns.","This frightened many of the pigs and they proceeded to their pen for protection.\n\nThe biggest pig, named Pork Chop, walked up to Bill and said. \u201cYou are a very mean bull, Bill.\u201d Bill snorted a reply. \u201cWell, you have a big, flat nose, a tornado tail and pink ears. Also, you are dirty, and smelly\u201d Then Bill lowered his head, snorted a great snort,and shook his horns at Pork Chop.","Pork Chop was a wise old pig and knew what Bill was doing. He wouldn\u2019t be bullied by any bull, even Bill.Now, Bill, the bullying bull, was expecting Pork Chop to mush through the mud and proceed to the pen for protection. But Pork Chop just stood there looking at him. Then Pork Chop said in a soft voice. \n\n\u201cYou are a very mean bull, Bill,\u201d and walked away","Then, Bill saw some sheep in the meadow. Bill began to walk across the big barnyard towards them. When he got there, he was met by the Roger Ram, the leader of the flock.\u201cI\u2019m Roger Ram, rejoicing at meeting my newest neighbor on Farmer Fred\u2019s farm,\u201d he said in a very polite manner.Bill ran at Roger Ram, snorting and shaking his big horns and said, \u201cI am Bill, the bull.I am the boss of the barnyard.\u201dIn a split second, Roger Ram, rammed Bill the bullying bull, between his big horns.","Bill, the bullying bull, looked at Roger Ram and said. \u201cAll that white curly hair, might give you lots of flair, but you ram like a ewe.\u201d Then Bill backed up, started to paw at the ground with his hefty hooves, snorted seven snorts, shook his horns, lowered his now lumpy head, and\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Roger Ram and the others retreated from the meadow. Bill, the bullying bull, was proud of what he had done.","All the barnyard animals were afraid of Bill. He was either threatening them with his size and big horns or making fun of the way they looked.It was not a pleasant day on Farmer Fred\u2019s farm. \u201cI am going to call him Bully Bill,\u201d \n\nsaid Henrietta Hen.","\u201cThat\u2019s not nice,\u201d responded Roy Rooster. \u201cIt\u2019s being a bully yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we will work on something to stop his bullying,\u201d replied Toby Turtle.\n\nRoger Ram said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we can do? I rammed him and he called me a ewe.\u201d","Dorothy Duck said, \u201cHe almost stepped on me with those heavy hooves. No one is safe!\u201d With tears in her eyes, little Patty Piglet said, \u201cI heard, I was going to be eaten by Farmer Fred. I\u2019m scared.\u201d Pork Chop said in a soft and soothing tone, \u201cDon\u2019t worry my friends. By the evening feed by Farmer Fred, Bill, the bullying bull, will become our buddy.\u201d","Bill was having so much fun. He certainly was the boss of the barnyard.\n\nHe looked around and saw a big barn, with open doors, and he just had to let whoever lived there know that he was boss of the barnyard. It was a bright sunny day but as Bill walked into the dark barn, he couldn\u2019t see anything. \n\nThis frightened him a little. He turned the corner around the door and \u2026 BOOM \u2026 he was stopped in mid stride. Bill realized that he had just walked into something really big. So big, it didn\u2019t move when he walked into it.","As Bill\u2019s eyes adjusted to the darkness in the barn, he started to see what had stopped him. He was looking at the chest of some big animal. Bill was scared.\n\nAs he looked up, he could see the biggest bull, with the biggest horns, staring down at him. A voice like thunder filled the barn. \u201cI finally get to meet Bill, the boss of the barnyard.\u201dNow Bill didn\u2019t know what to do or what to say. All he could do was look up at this giant and wonder what would happen next. There was silence in the barn for several minutes as Bill just looked up in amazement. Finally, the big bull said something.","\u201cI am Brian Bull and have lived on Farmer Fred\u2019s farm for many, many, years. In all those years, never have the other animals asked me for help.But today, they came to me with the story of a big bull that was bullying them and they asked me to put an end to it. I agreed!\u201dBill was never, ever, so frightened. Brian could toss him across the barnyard, with little effort, and one push from his head. Brian slowly lowered his head. Bill looked down and began to shake. Brian got closer and whispered into Bill\u2019s ear.\u201cWhat do you think I should do, Bill? I promised the other animals I would put a stop to your bullying.\u201d","\u201cI have never been so frightened in my life and I know how the other animals must have felt.\u201d Bill began to sob a little.\u201cI now know how it feels to be bullied and you didn\u2019t even really bully me. I have learned my lesson and I will go out and apologize to all the animals and ask them to forgive me","\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Brian said. \u201cYou already have.\u201d As Bill turned around, he saw all the other animals standing in the doorway.","\u201cHere pig-pig-pig, come on chick-chick \u2026.\u201d The animals heard Farmer Fred calling them for the evening feed."],"13":["\u201cHi!

Everyone was excited to be going on the adventure that they had been talking about for weeks. Their teacher, Miss Squirrel, had promised a trip to remember and the whole class now skipped excitedly through the meadow. Well, nearly all of the class; alone at the back of the group waddled Hank. Hank was a hedgehog who found it difficult to make friends. He always felt like the outsider. The others in the class, especially Matilda Mouse, kept away from Hank because they thought him odd. Yes, Hank was not really looking forward to the day.","The journey to the Shadow Woods was longer than expected because Mr. Mole\u2019s tunnel train was broken. Indeed Mr. Mole was there waving them off before he got back to work. This just made Miss Squirrel happier though, as she could talk to the children about all the wonderful flowers that filled Sunny Meadow. There was color everywhere. It looked as if a rainbow had crashed into the field. However, at the edge of the meadow, not everyone was looking at the flowers\u2026","Soon though, the Shadow Woods were upon them and something that looked small from far away suddenly grew very large before them. Each member of the class gave a slow gulp-Matilda Mouse, Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon. The biggest gulp came from Hank. He was nervous enough before they got to the woods and didn\u2019t have a friend to hold on to. Matilda pretended to be brave, however, and ran on ahead compelling her friends to join her.","Miss Squirrel was not happy about that and so she shouted for Matilda to come back. Then off she chased after her. Soon the whole class followed and before they knew it, they were right in the middle of the woods. Now instead of bright sunshine, only shadows scattered before them.","The class stopped, their little mouths open in awe and wonder. Miss Squirrel was still chasing Matilda though and did not notice that she had left the little ones behind. Rachel Rabbit, Wendy Weasel and Ralph Racoon all held paws as they looked around them. Three very small friends.And Hank.The only noise now in the woods was silence.","Suddenly, everyone got a fright as behind them Matilda mouse jumped from behind a berry-bush and shouted \u201cBOO!\u201d as loudly as she could. After they all had stopped shaking, her friends laughed.All except Hank. \u201cSilly Hank,\u201d said Matilda. \u201cYou are just no fun!\u201d","However, before Hank could reply, another noise made everyone turn around. This time though there was no Boo! of surprise and no laughter afterwards because there before the class was a very large and very hungry snake. His magical eyes twinkling with delight as his tongue spiked forward. \u201cMmmm!! Lunchtime.\u201d said the snake.It was at this point that the class realised that Miss Squirrel had not returned from chasing Matilda. The class was alone. Squeaks of fright squeezed out of the little animals\u2019 mouths. Matilda and her friends all hugged each other fearing that this was the end.","Suddenly though, Hank was scared no more. He found a way to save the class. He knew just what he had to do. \u201cQuick everyone- down this hole.\u201d he shouted as he pointed to a hole under a hanging chestnut Tree. The animals stared at him and then jumped down the hole. Hank followed only to be stopped by Matilda who looked very angry. \u201cHank, we are trapped now- you foolish hog.\u201d But before she could add to her insult, Hank jumped up and flipped himself into a ball. Next, he rolled towards the mouth of the hole and blocked it with his pointy sharp spikes. There would be no lunch for the snake today!","Later, back at school, Miss Squirrel was telling the head teacher, Mr Owl, about what had happened and how the snake had fled Hank\u2019s pointy spikes. After the snake had slithered away, the class had quickly returned to school and each one had thanked their new friend Hank. Matilda gave him a big hug and apologised for what she had called him before. Hank was not odd, he was a hero and her new best friend. Hank, who was still unused to lots of attention, turned pink and popped into a ball as all his new friends cheered him."],"5":["\u201cI\u2019m Rose.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Violet.\u201d \u201cAnd we are identical twins.\u201d They said at the same time. \n\n\u201cWe look the same,\u201d said Rose. \u201cWe sound the same,\u201d said Violet. \u201cWe even dress the same,\u201d they said together as they giggled.","\u201cIt\u2019s my birthday,\u201d said Rose. \u201cNo, it\u2019s my birthday,\u201d said Violet.

I wonder why. \u201cI can tell you why,\u201d their mom said. \u201cRose is a little more responsible and pays attention to fine details.","Violet is a little less responsible and sometimes doesn\u2019t pay attention to things she doesn\u2019t like doing.\u201d","\u201cCome on in, girls,\u201d their mom yelled out the door. \u201cIt\u2019s time to open your presents and your dad and I want to see how you like them.\u201d Oh!

Then they smiled at one another as they each dashed for a box. \u201cI want this one,\u201d yelled Rose. \u201cNo! I want that one,\u201d yelled Violet.","\u201cGirls!\u201d Their mom said. \u201cYou know it doesn\u2019t make any difference, they are both the same.\u201d","Rose and Violet laughed when they realized how silly they had acted. Of course, the presents would be identical, just like them. They each got a box unwrapped, opened, and then looked inside. Rose happily yelled, \u201cStuff to make a flower garden. This is great, something I always wanted to do. I can grow my own flower garden.\u201d","Violet said, \u201cI like flowers, and a garden would be nice. But there\u2019s a lot of stuff in this box and it seems like it would be a lot of work.\u201d Violet was right. There was a lot of stuff in the box.","It contained everything they needed to make a flower garden, everything except water, sunshine, and love. Both girls thanked their mom and dad for the great present and they dragged their heavy boxes outside to start their gardens.\n\nThey each selected a patch of ground to call her own, took the \u201cHow To Garden\u201d book from the box, and began to read. Rose said, \u201cViolet, you were right. This is going to be a lot of work.\u201d","They carefully removed the grass, loosened up the ground, added and mixed in the special flower soil, and planted their flower seeds. Violet found some nice sticks and pretty ribbon to make a fence around her garden. She gave the seeds their first watering and said, \u201cRose, I am going inside to watch television.\u201d","Rose asked her Dad to help her make a stone fence around her garden.\n\n\u201cA very special garden needs a very special fence,\u201d she said to him as they gathered and placed the stones. After some time the fence was completed and Rose gave the seeds their first watering.","\u201cWell, maybe later. Right now I want to eat breakfast, and then I think I\u2019ll play a game.\u201d Violet said. Every morning Rose tended her garden and every morning Violet had something else to do. Every morning Rose would remind Violet to water her garden and Violet would reply, \u201cLet Mother Nature take care of it.\u201d","One morning Rose checked on her garden and she couldn\u2019t believe what she saw. Her garden was covered with little flower plants. She was so excited she danced with joy. Then she looked at Violets garden. It didn\u2019t have many plants, but there were some.","Rose opened her \u201cHow To Garden\u201d book to see what she should do next. \u201cHmm,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cI must thin the plants. I need to take some out to make room for the others to grow.\u201d Rose felt bad. She loved her flowers and now had to pull some out of the ground. Then she had an idea.","I\u2019ll plant the ones I pull from my garden into Violets. And that is exactly what she did. Rose then gave both gardens a big drink of water. She loved her garden and there was no reason she shouldn\u2019t love her sister\u2019s equally.","Their mom watched from the kitchen window. She was very proud of the way Rose was helping her sister. Rose was looking at her garden when she heard Violet coming out the door. \u201cWow!\u201d Violet said when she saw her garden. \u201cLook at all those plants Rose. I have just as many as you. Our gardens are really growing.\u201d \u201cViolet,\u201d Rose said. \u201cDo you know that I \u2026\u201d And she stopped talking for a second, as she was angry.

Just like the \u201cHow To Garden\u201d book recommended. They were pleased. The plants were growing and many had buds that we re ready to open.","Oh! It wouldn\u2019t be long now. It wouldn\u2019t be long before there were two beautiful flower gardens. The girls were so excited. They just couldn\u2019t wait to see all the colorful flowers. The next morning they got dressed and hurried outside to tend their gardens. To their surprise, they were in full bloom. They shrieked with excitement, held hands, and danced in circles. The flowers were so beautiful. \n\nEvery color in the rainbow was in their gardens.","\u201cWe have a surprise for you! You are going to have a baby brother soon. And your dad and I know you will take care of him as well as you take care of your gardens. Aren\u2019t you girls excited?\u201d Rose and Violet just stood there. They didn\u2019t know what to say. All these years they were a family of four, and now there was going to be a strange fifth member. Another member that would need his parent\u2019s love. Love that should be theirs, and they did not know if they wanted to share.","\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, girls?\u201d their dad asked. \u201cYour mom and I thought you would be happy and excited. Let\u2019s have a glass of milk and maybe a cookie or two. Then you can tell us why the frowns.\u201d As all four were licking the center from their cream filled cookie, Violet spoke up. \u201cYou are going to love me less because you are going to have to give him love.\u201d \u201cI feel the same way,\u201d said Rose. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to love me less.\u201d","\u201cMy goodness,\u201d their mom said. \u201cWe could never love either of you less. Where did you get that idea?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not an idea,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThere are two of us and two pieces of love, one from you, and one from dad. When there are three of us, you\u2019re both going to take some of that love away from us, and give it to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, girls.\u201d Their dad said. \u201cLove isn\u2019t shared. Love is magical and it grows.\n\n Why each day your mom and I love you more than the day before, and tomorrow we will love you more than we do today.\u201d","Her mom then asked. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Rose. \u201cI love the plants and I love my sister so I thought I would share the plants with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d said her mom. \u201cShare the plants. That must mean that you loved your plants less because you gave some to Violet.\u201d Rose thought about what her mom had said, then replied. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t love my plants any less.\u201d","\u201cI loved them the same and I loved the ones in Violet\u2019s garden, and I loved doing something nice for her, and I loved watching both gardens grow, and I love the flowers in both gardens, and I love you. Now I understand how magical love is, and how it grows.\u201d \u201cMe too,\u201d said Violet. \u201cLet\u2019s go out and smell the flowers.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d said Rose."],"17":["Deep in the New Forest where no big people ever went there was a tiny little magical village called the Ordon Gardens. Here, three little tooth fairies named Incisor, Canine and Molar were busy at work in their factory. The three tooth fairies were all named after types of teeth.","Incisor was tall and skinny with short pink hair, Canine was also tall with blue hair and Molar was the short, wise one with curly, silver locks. All day long the busy little fairies cleaned and shined the children\u2019s milk teeth they had collected during the night.","The milk teeth were used to make very useful things in the Ordon Gardens like roads in the village and furniture in the homes for the little fairies.","One day Incisor realised that the teeth coming into the cleaning factory were not as strong as they used be.\u201cOh dear!\u201d said Incisor \u201cThese teeth are fragile and brittle, with holes and black spots. They crumble as soon as I try to polish them with my cloth. Whatever are we to do?\u201d","\u201cYes.\u201dsaid Canine \u201cI know exactly what\u2019s wrong, The children are beginning to eat far too many sweets and are not looking after their teeth at all.\u201d \u201cI know\u2026we can fix it!\u201d Said Molar the wise one. She sounded quite excited by her grand idea.","The three fairies looked at each other and waited while Molar explained all. As usual, it was a fabulous idea. The three of them wasted no time at all and got to work straight away.","That night, it was Canine\u2019s turn to fly off and collect all the milk teeth from under the sleeping children\u2019s pillow. Off she flew with a bag of coins, some white berry sandwiches for her lunch and a pack of cards which the three fairies had spent all afternoon preparing.","It was such a treat to leave the forest and see the city skyline but it was a dangerous place for fairies. Canine had to make sure that the big people never saw her.","She flew through the starry sky and saw the wonderful city fast asleep.\n\nHer first stop was a young boy named Junior.","Earlier in the night Junior and his mum had placed his milk tooth under the pillow. Mummy tucked Junior into bed and told him all about the tooth fairy who would leave some money in exchange for his tooth. She gave him a goodnight kiss and left him to fall asleep.","By the time Canine arrived, Junior was fast asleep. She flew in through the top window that was ajar and glided quickly down to Junior\u2019s pillow. She perched beside him and braced herself in preparation for the task\u2026","\u201cHeave\u2026\u2026..\u201d she lifted the pillow and wedged herself between the pillow and the bed. She quickly grabbed the tooth and tossed it over to her backpack.","She placed two coins and the fairy\u2019s special card in exchange under the\n\npillow and flew off into the night sky to find more milk teeth.","In the morning, as soon as Junior woke up, he rummaged under the pillow to see if the tooth fairy had left any money for him. \n\nHe was thrilled to find the coins but looked blankly at the card he found in his hand. Mummy didn\u2019t mention anything about a card\u2026he wondered.","He read the card out aloud\u2026 \n\nThe Tooth Fairy\u2019s guide to healthy teeth:\n\n1.Eat Healthy.\n\n2.Cut down on sugary sweets & drinks.\n\n3.Brush your teeth twice a day.\n\n4.Use a fluoride toothpaste.\n\n5.Visit the Dentist regularly.","Back in the village of Ordon Gardens, the fairies were very happy about the new information card they were giving to the children. Soon enough the milk teeth coming into the factory were strong and healthy again."],"35":["Dylan the young, blue dragon lived deep in the Rockstone Mountains of Scotland. Everyday the playful, young dragon woke up early in the morning and flew all around the mountains and valleys looking for something to do.","When he was hungry he would go home to his cave where Mummy dragon would have hot soup ready for his dinner.","\u201cWash your wings and get ready for tea. I\u2019ve made your favourite today, darling\u2026 pea and toad soup\u201d said mummy dragon.Dylan sighed, \u201cEhhh\u2026Thank you mum.\u201d he said sadly.","\u201cWhatever is the matter, son? Everyday you come back home happily for your tea but today you look so sad.\u201d inquired mummy dragon.","\u201cI\u2019m lonely, mum. I can\u2019t find anyone to play with. In all the lakes, mountains and valleys in Rockstone, there isn\u2019t a single dragon for me to play with.\u201d he grumbled","\u201cWell, how about this for an idea? Why don\u2019t you fly down to the \n\nvillage playground and see if the children there want to play \n\nwith you?\u201d","Dylan woke up bright and early the next day. He was very excited that he would soon have friends to play with everyday.","He put on his baseball cap and school tie and flew past the valleys and mountains until he reached the little village of Falkrik.","He glided down to a passer-by \n\nto ask for directions to \n\nthe children\u2019s playground.","\u201cThat.. that.. that way.\u201d pointed the quivering man.\n\n\u201cOh! He must be cold.\u201d thought Dylan.

The playground was filled with smart young children in bright red and grey uniforms with their school ties. Dylan tugged at his tie and cleared his throat, He felt very well dressed for the occasion. \n\nHe was about to open his mouth to introduce himself when he suddenly heard\u2026","\u201cAAARRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!! \n\nruuuunnnnnnnnn It\u2019s a dragon, he\u2019s going to burn us ALIVE!!!!!!!\u201d yelled one of the young boys. \n\nAll the children ran frantically\n\n towards the exits and \n\ndisappeared in no time.","Dylan sighed sadly. All he wanted was some friends to play with but clearly humans were very scared of dragons.","He flew home with his head hung low to see what mummy dragon had made for tea.","The next day Dylan decided to try and make friends with the children in the playground again. He tucked his white handkerchief in his left gill and scooped up a large branch lying on the floor. He made it into a white surrender flag\u2026 He crossed his claws and hoped the children would give him a another chance.","Down he flew again into the \n\ncentre of the playground with his white surrender flag clenched in his jaw. \u201cI just want to play and be friends.\u201d he said softly.\n\n\u201cBut how will you play with us?\u201d shouted one of the girls. \u201cYour\u2019re too big for our swings and slides.

They climbed onto Dylan\u2019s back and off the children went on a very exciting flight.","From that day Dylan \n\nand the playground \n\nchildren were friends and every day Dylan, the dragon would take the children on the best \n\nplayground ride ever."],"14":["Many years ago, deep in the North Woods, lived a great bear named Paw-Paw.\nHe was the strongest and bravest bear\nalive and respected by all the forest creatures.","One day, all the animals gathered together to discuss some changes in the woods.\nA new animal that walked on two legs and was\ncovered in strange fur was making its home nearby. They needed a leader and could think of no one better than Paw-Paw.","They all marched to Paw-Paws\u2019 cave and asked if he would be the king of the forest.\nPaw-Paw was thrilled and even though\nhe didn\u2019t know what being a king was all about, he gladly accepted.","Paw-Paw then said \u201cI will need some helpers and I want Crowly Crow and Willard Weasel to be my advisors.\u201d\nWell, Crowly and Willard were honored,\nand both agreed to work with King Paw-Paw.","One day, Slither, the snake visited King Paw-Paw and told him of a strange animal he saw close by. Paw-Paw asked, \u201cWhere did you see this animal?\u201dSlither replied.\u201cIt lives with the strange, two- legged creature \n\nat the edge of our woods.\u201d","Paw-Paw thought for a moment and said. \u201cWillard and Crowly - go to the edge of the woods and see what this animal is.\u201d Within moments, his two helpers were on their way.","In a short while, they were at the edge of the woods watching the strange animal. King Paw-Paw said,\u201c Willard, go to the animal and ask what he is and why there is a rope tied around his neck.\u201d Without hesitation, Willard scampered across the field and hid behind some piled wood close to the strange animal.","\u201cPsst!\u201d said Willard.The strange animal looked around. \u201cPsst! I am over here behind the woodpile,\u201d Willard said in a louder voice. The strange animal stretched the rope as far as it would go but not being able to see who was speaking said, \u201cPlease come out so that I can see you. My master isn\u2019t around.\u201d","Willard came out slowly from behind the woodpile and cautiously approached the strange animal. \u201cWhat type of an animal are you?\u201d asked Willard. \u201cI am a dog. And my name is Dillard.\u201d He replied. \u201cAnd what are you?\u201d he then asked. \u201cMe \u2026 I am Willard, the Weasel representing King Paw-Paw, ruler of the forest.\u201d","\u201cWhy are you bound to that stake in the ground?\u201d asked Willard. \u201cMy master keeps me tied so I cannot go into the woods,\u201d replied Dillard. \u201cNo animal should be tied,\u201d Willard shouted. \u201cI shall bite through the rope to set you free. You can then come into the woods and live with me.\u201d","As the summer passed, King Paw-Paw fattened himself on berries and salmon,Dillard and Willard became good friends.","One day, Willard sniffed the air. Oh, what a marvelous smell was being carried on the breeze. \u201cChicken eggs \u2026 Fresh chicken eggs,\u201d Willard thought to himself. \u201cI must find them and have a snack.\u201d In seconds, he was off running through the woods and following his nose to his favorite treat.","His nose lead him to the strange creature\u2019s house, where he had first met Dillard. He looked around \u2026 All was clear. He followed the wonderful smell of eggs into a strange cave. He looked around and couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. There were chicken eggs, hundreds of chicken eggs all around him.","As he reached for an egg, a chicken saw him and sounded the alarm. Soon all the chickens were clucking, squawking, and making a fuss.","Then he heard something behind him. As he turned, he saw the strange creature that lived there. The one that Dillard called master. There was no escape and Willard was terrified.","The strange creature looked at Willard and said, \u201cYou varmint! You are the weasel that set Dillard free.

Once in a while, it would start to come out of its shell and then quickly pop back in and cover its face with its giant claw. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for a new and bigger shell for his home,\u201d said their mom. \u201cI\u2019m glad I was able to find you two,this place is big.\u201d","Tammy looked at the crab and said \u201cBye, Hector. We\u2019ll miss you.\u201d Jimmy waved to him and turned to walk away. As the three were leaving, they heard a tapping on the glass. \u201cI don\u2019t believe this,\u201d said their mom. \u201cThat crab is saying good-bye to you two. I guess we\u2019ll just have to buy him and have a new pet.\u201d Now the fun began. They had the sales-person get Hector (since Tammy already named him) and put him into a box. Then they bought him a new cage, hermit crab bedding, several shells, a swimming pool, water dish, special food,some rocks, and everything Hector neededto be at home \u2013 in their home.","Tammy and Jimmy took excellent care of Hector and their mom was happy to see that they were so responsible with their little friend. But as time passed, Hector seemed to be less and less happy. After all, no matter how nice his human friends were, he didn\u2019t have any friends of his own kind. Hector missed his family and the open spaces of the lagoon that he was accustomed to.","One morning, Jimmy and Tammy decided that although Hector was a good pet, he deserved things they couldn\u2019t give him. \u201cMom,\u201d Tammy asked from across the room. \u201cCan we let Hector go?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you like him any more?\u201d she inquired. \u201cOf course we do,\u201d said Jimmy. \u201cBut he isn\u2019t happy here and setting him free would be the best for him.\u201d \u201cHmm,\u201d their mom thought. \u201cTammy and Jimmy are very unselfish and very smart. I am so proud of them.\u201d","Later that day, their mom took Tammy, Jimmy, Hector, and all of Hectors\u2019 things to the lagoon across from the plaza.Tammy carefully took Hector from his cage and placed him in the sand next to the shallows. Jimmy put his swimming pool and rocks in the sand and their mom placed his food dish securely between two rocks.\n\nAs they left with the empty cage, they thought they heard a faint tapping on a rock. They turned to see Hector and several other hermit crabs slowly crawling into the shallows.","A true act of love is ensuring that everyone is happy."],"43":["On a beach by a tree, sat my family and me.","Then shouted a hog, \"There's a Dog On A Log!!\"","A Dog On A Log?

My mom said, \u201cOkay Allie Kay, if you can get the ball in the bowl, in one try, you can have a PET FISH.\u201d","I didn\u2019t know what to say. Mom said I could have a PET FISH. As I looked at all the fish, and watched others tossing balls at the bowls, I spotted the prettiest goldfish I had ever seen.I just had to have him. I took aim, gently tossed the ball at the bowl, and then tightly closed my eyes. I just could not look.","\u201cWe have a winner,\u201d I heard the nice man say. When I opened my eyes, he was holding out the fishbowl and the prettiest goldfish for me to take.\u201cI am going to name you Moebus,\u201d I said to the fish. (I think I saw him smile). Then I looked at Mom. I didn\u2019t know her face could look so funny. As we were leaving the game, the nice man said. \u201cRemember, don\u2019t feed him too much.\u201d","I had MY FIRST PET! When we got home, I told mom not to worry. I would be responsible and take very good care of Moebus.","Every day I would feed Moebus and talk to him. I even tried to get him to do tricks. But that didn\u2019t work. After several days, Moebus didn\u2019t look too good. I asked mom what I should do but she didn\u2019t know. She said she never had a pet and that I had said I would be responsible for Moebus.I was sad and scared. I didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to Moebus.","\u201cAllie Kay,\u201d mom said. \u201cThe man down the street has a fishpond, maybe he can help Moebus.\u201d I picked up the bowl and headed to my neighbor\u2019s house as fast as I could. Mom was right behind me.I had seen the man many times and knew that his children were grown and had children of their own. But I had never talked to him.I was nervous and a little scared. But I rang his doorbell.","\u201cHi,\u201d I said in a bubbly voice. \u201cMy name is Allie Kay and I live down the street.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d he said. \u201cI am Ted but my Grandchildren call me Pop Pop, and you can too. Oh, I see you have a very pretty goldfish. What\u2019s his name?\u201d\u201cMoebus,\u201d I replied. Pop Pop continued. \u201cMoebus looks like he needs his water changed, come on out back to my fishpond and we will refresh him.\u201d","Pop Pop said. \u201cAllie Kay, you are a very responsible young person.You recognized that Moebus was a little under the weather and got him some help. Others may have just let him live in dirty water, getting sicker, and sicker. You must really love Moebus.\u201d \u201cOh! I do,\u201d I said. \u201cMoebus is my first pet. Will he be alright?\u201d","At that, Pop Pop put Moebus in the fishpond with all the other fish.I started to say something and Pop Pop said. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s get Moebus a bigger bowl (I\u2019ll trade you this small one for a big one).\u201d How could I refuse? Pop Pop then gave me a big bowl and said go get some gravel, wash it, put it in the bowl, and fill the bowl with water. I did and by the time I was done, Pop Pop had Moebus in a net and ready for his new home. My mom and I thanked Pop Pop and as we were leaving, he said two things. To me - \u201cRemember to change his water every three days and if you need help please ask.\u201d To my mom \u2013 \u201cYou must be proud to have such a responsible and caring pet owner as your daughter.\u201d","As mom and I stood by the table and watched Moebus swimming in his new home, she gave me a hug and said, \u201cI am glad you got your first pet.\u201d"],"0":["\u201cHi! My name is Samuel and I want to be a scientist. You may be wondering why and my answer is simple. I am amazed at all the wonderful things like rockets to the Moon, fire trucks pumping out all that water, fast race cars, space ships, and the list goes on. But those are big things and I just don\u2019t understand everything about them yet.\n\nI also wonder about small things like-how does sugar turn into crystals called rock candy? Or how are those rock formations in caves made? Hmm \u2013 I know it has something to do with Science.\n\nMy sister Samantha wants to be a scientist too, but she likes things that I don\u2019t-like why her dolls eyes open and close. But even though we don\u2019t like the same things, it\u2019s still Science so we get along just fine. In fact, our teachers help us better understand Math,\n\ntechnology, current events and trends - all of which are important. We even help each other and have lots of fun.","I like to experiment or take things apart to see how they work. No matter what I do, I tell my mom or dad what I am going to be doing and sometimes even ask for their help. I would never just do something \u2013 I could get hurt.\n\nSometimes it\u2019s best to start small, that\u2019s what I did. I remember my first experiment in detail and it was a lot of fun to do. It had to do with growing small crystals, much like the way rock candy is made. You may be wondering why that is important and all I can say is that it\u2019s the basis for making any type of crystal. Their shape and size depends on many things and the more you read about them, the more you experiment, the more you grow interesting crystals. \n\nTry this experiment; I call it The Crystal Bowl. It\u2019s lots of fun and there is nothing dangerous about it. Because I am using a common chemical I let my mom know what I am doing.\n\nHere is what you need:\n\n\u2022 A small clear bowl to grow the crystals in\n\n\u2022 Epsom salt (a common chemical)\n\n\u2022 Food coloring\n\n\u2022 A measuring cup","The Experiment :In the clear bowl, stir \u00bd cup of Epsom salts with \u00bd cup of very hot tap water. The hotter, the better.\n\nStir for at least 1 minute. You will be making a saturated solution (scientific talk)-meaning that the water cannot hold any more of the Epsom salts. Some undissolved salt crystals will be at the bottom of the bowl.\n\nAdd a couple of drops of your favorite food coloring. I like red.\n\nPlace the bowl in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours. I put a sign on the bowl \u2013 Samantha-Do Not Eat! (I\u2019m so funny.)\n\nTake out your bowl of crystals and pour out the extra water that may be at the bottom. Have fun examining them.","Okay, it\u2019s time to get Scientific. What just happened? You just made Magnesium sulfate crystals. Magnesium sulfate is the actual name for Epsom salt. \n\nThe temperature of the water determines just how much Magnesium sulfate it can hold. The hotter the water, the more it can hold, and the more crystals it can grow.","So why did we put it in the refrigerator? By rapidly cooling the water we forced fast crystal growth. The quickly cooling water became denser and made the Magnesium sulfate atoms run into each other joining together into crystal structures. When you grow crystals this way they will be small, thin, and a lot of them. If you let the water evaporate slowly you will get different crystals. You will have to experiment to see the results.That is Science! Oh, don\u2019t forget to clean up any mess and ask your mom or dad to really clean anything you might reuse.Have you ever seen those really neat formations in a cave? They are commonly called stalactites (they grow from the top of the cave down) and stalagmites (that grow from the cave floor up).Want to make some? I\u2019ll bet you do!","Again there is nothing dangerous, but let your mom or dad know what you are doing. This experiment takes some time and could get a little messy.Here is what you need:\u2022 Two glass jars\u2022 A large plate or pan\u2022 Baking soda\u2022 String\u2022 Paper clips\u2022 Water","The Experiment : Fill the two jars with hot water. The hotter, the better.Stir in as much baking soda as will dissolve in the water. Mix it up well and make that saturated solution.Cut the string so it can go close to the bottom of the jars and go between them when they are several inches apart. Then tie a paper clip to each end to act as weights.Put one end of the weighted string into each of the jars.Place the jars on the large plate or pan, making sure the string has a little dip in the center. The plate or pan is needed to catch the drips of your scientific solution.Put your experiment in a safe place for 3 to 4 weeks. Keep an eye on it and watch your formation grow.","What has happened? The saturated solution is carried through the string. This process is called capillary action.\n\nWhen it gets to the dip in the string it drips onto the plate or pan. It is similar to water passing through the ground, picking up minerals, and falling through a cave. Over time the dripping water evaporates and creates stalactites and stalagmites.","It\u2019s magic! Well, actually it is Science and takes place all over the world. \n\nScience is fun and I am glad I am going to be a scientist.Maybe you\u2019ll decide to be one too.\u201d"],"47":["Arrgh, me hearties, I has a story for ye, a story of untold riches and a young lad who found \u2018em. And who am I, ye ask? Well - I be the spirit of Sand-dollar, a pirate and buccaneer, Captain of the Seahorse, the finest ship to ever sail the seven seas.","Ah, she was a fine vessel. Three masts and ten sails made her fast, and her sleek hull let her cut through the waves with ease. Me crew was the finest bunch of sailors to ever set sail on the open seas. They came from all over the world, to serve on the Seahorse, and share in the riches.","I remember we just hid the treasure and I found a safe place to hide me treasure map. A familiar place, a place, where as a young lad, before the sea called me to service, was me home. As we finished burying the treasure, we saw a storm approaching from the East. It was a bad one. The wind was a howling, rain soaked us to our very bones, thunder roared, and the lightening frightened the bravest of me crew. We were in the longboat, just about to board the Seahorse, when it happened.","The bottom of the sea opened and the waters began draining. The waters started going round and round. Slowly at first, and then picking up speed until we were in a whirlpool. It didn\u2019t take long for the swirling waters to suck the Seahorse to the bottom of the sea. As for us in the longboat, we watched her go down as we spiraled around that whirlpool before getting sucked down with her.","Arrgh! It makes me heart happy to see that lad growing like he is. They call him Sandy, after me. Ya see I\u2019m his Great-Great-Great-Grandpa.\u201d \u201cSandy,\u201d called his mom from the house. \u201cYou forgot you chores for the day. Remember you were going to clean the attic.\u201d","\u201cOh,\u201d grumbled Sandy as he slowly walked to the house. \u201cI don\u2019t mind chores, but cleaning the attic! There hasn\u2019t been anyone up there in years.\u201d","\u201cIt must be dark, dirty, and full of spiders and other creepy things. There is probably even a ghost or two living up there with the spiders.\u201d","\u201cI unlocked the door to the attic,\u201d his mom said. \u201cBe careful, it\u2019s a little dark and there is a lot of stuff just lying around or stacked in piles.\u201d","The spirit of Sand-dollar thought to himself as he watched Sandy. \u201cArrgh, I must have looked the same on that stormy night when I hid me treasure map in that very room. I wonder if it will be finally found.\u201d","\u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad,\u201d Sandy said to himself. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of neat stuff up here. I\u2019ll clean as I move and organize all these different things.\u201d \u201cArrgh,\u201d Sand-dollar thought to himself. \u201cThat lad be a hard worker. I\u2019d have him on me crew if I could. He\u2019s only been up here a few hours and he\u2019s almost done.\u201d","\u201cOne last thing to clean and move,\u201d Sandy said aloud. (Even though he knew, no one was there to hear him). \u201cI\u2019ll just wipe down this old trunk and slide it over there in the corner. Wow! This thing is heavy; I think I\u2019ll have to empty it before I can get it to move.\u201d","\u201cArrgh,\u201d Sand-dollar thought to himself. \u201cThe lad be getting close to me map.

At last, someone can find me treasure and be rich beyond belief.\u201d Sand-dollar said.","\u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d his dad asked. \u201cIt was in this old book. I couldn\u2019t move this old trunk in the attic so I started taking things out when I saw the book. When I opened the book, the map fell out.\u201d Sandy replied.Sandy\u2019s mom added. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly old and it\u2019s definitely a treasure map. And look here, whatever it leads to is buried on our property.\u201d","\u201cLook at this note on the side,\u201d his dad, said. \u201cIt says the finder will have untold wealth and be rich beyond belief.

Tomorrow morning we are going on a treasure hunt,\u201d his dad said. \u201cYippee!\u201d Sandy exclaimed. \u201cArrgh, it appears me treasure is close to being found.\u201d Sand-dollar said.","\u201cSandy, you take the shovel, mom can read the map, and I\u2019ll use the compass,\u201d his dad said as they walked into the yard to begin their treasure hunt. \u201cArrgh, look at em go.
